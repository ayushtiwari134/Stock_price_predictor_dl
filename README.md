## Stock price predictor to analyze the performance of the model over a large period of time
### My very first deep learning project.
This is a full stack end to end project with the model trained in *jupyter notebook*, the backend file written in *python*, and for simplicity, the frontend created using *streamlit*.<br>
The deep learning model is an LSTM model which is used on time-series data which comes in handy with the current project

### About the project
* Data is fetched from *yahoo finance* regarding the price of a stock over a period of 10 years
* The data is preprocessed and fed into the model to create predictions
* Charts regarding the *50-day*, *100-day* and even *200-day* *moving averages* of the particular stock are drawn
* The predictions are plotted along with the correct price in a plot using matplotlib
* The entire interface is displayed as a frontend webapp using *streamlit* and coded out in python
